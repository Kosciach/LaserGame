  <h2>Reactor</h2>
  
Reactor represents player's health, 7core means 7hp. Each time reactor is hit, all nerby enemy bullets are destroyed (result of core explosion).<br>
When all cores are gone, reactor explodes and destroys all enemies and their bullets.


<br><br>
  <h2>Fighting back</h2>
  
By putting two fingers on a screen, player creates energy shield that has an ability to turn enemy bullets into player's.<br>
Player's bullets explode on impact with enemy and destroy both enemies and enemy bullets.<br>
Each enemy kill increments the score and checks if highscore should be updated.
